# dCrowd

A decentralized marketplace based on blockchain (written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for execution on the Internet Computer Protocol) that allows for the creation and sale of NFTs (based on ICRC-7 and other standards) to fund events. This platform uses NFTs as tools for crowdfunding, enabling event organizers to raise funds directly from the community. NFT buyers receive special rights or exclusive benefits related to the supported events in return, such as priority access or special content. The platform is designed to ensure transparency and security in transactions, using smart contracts to automate the distribution of funds and rewards in a fair and efficient manner.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dCrowd/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy

# Create new identity which will be the minter identity
dfx identity new minter

# Export constants
export MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID=$(dfx ledger account-id) 
export DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID=$(dfx ledger account-id) 

# Create local replica of the ledger for transfering tokens
dfx deploy --specified-id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai icp_ledger_canister --argument "
  (variant {
    Init = record {
      minting_account = \"$MINTER_ACCOUNT_ID\";
      initial_values = vec {
        record {
          \"$DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID\";
          record {
            e8s = 10_000_000_000 : nat64;
          };
        };
      };
      send_whitelist = vec {};
      transfer_fee = opt record {
        e8s = 10_000 : nat64;
      };
      token_symbol = opt \"LICP\";
      token_name = opt \"Local ICP\";
    }
  })
"
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
